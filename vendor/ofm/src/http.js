/**
 * Outbound HTTP for the free lane: request posting, SSE line extraction, and the
 * classification of gateway failures into the harness's provider-neutral codes.
 *
 * The gateway reports a refusal as a JSON error envelope whose `type` is the
 * machine-readable discriminator. Three of them matter operationally and are
 * distinguished here because they need different handling:
 *
 * - `RegionError`  — the model exists but this egress country is excluded. Not a
 *   credential or capacity problem, and it clears the moment the user's egress
 *   changes, so it feeds the availability probe rather than a retry.
 * - `FreeUsageLimitError` / 429 — the per-session quota is spent; retrying with
 *   a fresh session makes it worse, which is why the session id is stable.
 * - `ModelError` / "Model is unavailable" — the pooled account no longer routes
 *   that id at all.
 *
 * How a 2xx body is read is decided by the body, not by `Content-Type`: this
 * gateway is observed answering 200 with a JSON content type over an SSE frame
 * stream, and believing the header cost the whole turn (issue #6). The head is
 * sniffed and then replayed into the stream reader, so no token is buffered.
 *
