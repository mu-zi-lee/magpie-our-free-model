/**
 * The lane's own egress: one switchable outlet every upstream request walks out
 * through.
 *
 * Three call sites make the requests the region gate and the per-IP pools see —
 * `postStreamed` and `getJson` in src/http.js, `detectEgress` in src/probe.js —
 * and all three used to be a bare `fetch`. This module keeps them on `fetch`
 * and moves the routing underneath: with an outlet configured, `egressFetch`
 * rewrites the call to a loopback relay it owns, and the relay opens the real
 * connection through the outlet. The call sites keep their bodies, headers,
 * signals and `redirect: 'error'` policy verbatim, so a proxied turn and a
 * direct one differ in exactly one thing: which socket leaves this machine.
 *
 * Two outlet shapes, one dialer:
 *
 *   - `client`   — an http/https/socks5 proxy address that already exists (the
 *                  user's own client, a LAN gateway). The plugin dials it.
 *   - `subscription` — the plugin spawns mihomo (Clash Verge's core, or any
 *                  mihomo/clash binary found on the machine) with a
 *                  proxy-provider pointing at the subscription URL and a
 *                  url-test group that re-measures every node every five
 *                  minutes. The lowest-latency node wins, a 429 in the
 *                  health-check marks the node dead and takes it out of the
 *                  rotation, and the plugin only ever dials the local mixed
 *                  port — it never parses a vless/vmess/trojan URI itself.
 *
 * Why spawn rather than embed: the light route (parse `http(s)/socks5` entries
 * and dial them in-process) cannot express a vless-REALITY subscription at all,
 * and a 108-byte PROXY-style trick cannot either — the protocol work belongs to
 * a purpose-built binary that already does health scoring and group selection.
 * The plugin's job is the seam: config in, local port out, `egressFetch`
 * unchanged between modes.
 *
 * Security notes that the settings route relies on:
 *
 *   - The relay binds `127.0.0.1` on an ephemeral port and is deliberately not
 *     an open proxy: every start mints a random key, `egressFetch` presents it,
 *     and any other caller — a neighbouring local process, a rebound page — is
 *     refused before a single dial. A keyed caller still needs an absolute
 *     http(s) target, and nothing else in the process rewrites.
 *   - The managed mihomo's mixed port is passworded (`authentication`) with a
 *     per-start credential the plugin is the only holder of, so the outlet
 *     cannot be borrowed by another process on this machine.
 *   - The subscription URL is a bearer credential: it is written to the mihomo
 *     config file (mode 0600-ish, inside the plugin's own data dir), never
 *     logged, and surfaced to the settings page as a hostname only.
 *   - `mihomoPath` comes from local settings, which the trust fence already
 *     gates the same way it gates every other write; there is no download step
 *     anywhere in this file.
