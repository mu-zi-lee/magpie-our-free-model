/**
 * Reasoning-effort policy.
 *
 * A live probe of this lane (2026-09-24) settled the design: the gateway accepts
 * `reasoning_effort`, `thinking.budget_tokens`, `enable_thinking` and
 * `thinking_budget` and then ignores all of them — three samples per spelling
 * showed `low` producing *more* reasoning tokens than `xhigh`, and the unknown
 * fields occasionally surfaced as an upstream 503. The single control the pooled
 * account actually enforces is `max_tokens`, and reasoning volume tracks it
 * directly (a 64-token ceiling pulled reasoning from ~397 tokens down to ~63).
 *
 * So an effort level here is a real, enforced generation budget rather than a
 * hint. Every declared level therefore changes measured behaviour; a level that
 * could not be enforced would not be declared, because an effort menu that does
 * nothing is worse to a user than no effort menu at all.
 *
 * Because the ceiling is shared by thinking and the visible answer, a lower
 * level shortens both — that is the only modulation this lane offers, and it is
 * why the levels are stated as token budgets rather than as vague adjectives.
 *
 * A model whose thinking cannot be switched off pays for it out of the same
 * ceiling before the answer starts, so every rung of its ladder is doubled: one
 * rung then leaves the answer about as much room as it has on a model that can
 * think nothing at all. Measured on `mimo-v2.6-flash-free` over the 92 calls of
 * one day: 82% of the output tokens were reasoning, so the un-doubled 8192
 * ceiling left roughly 1500 for the answer and a long turn ended in `length`
 * about every third request.
 *
 * @module src/effort.js
